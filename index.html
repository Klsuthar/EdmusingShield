                                    helped
                                    me immensely in improving my essay writing and comprehension skills.
                                    She provided excellent resources, answer examples, and vocabulary support that were
                                    extremely useful for the IGCSE curriculum.</p>

                                    comprehension
                                    and descriptive writing. I learned how to understand passages better and explain
                                    them
                                    clearly in my own words. This helped me to think more deeply about what I'm reading.
                                    Also, I
                                    was able to practice writing descriptions, which help me a lot to be confident in
                                    expressing
                                    my own ideas in a descriptive way. In addition, I slowly started to understand how
                                    to
                                    identify the main points for writing a summary. Even now I feel that I need more
                                    practice
                                    and learning but I hope this class will help me improve my English skills.</p>
